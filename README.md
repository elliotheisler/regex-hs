# regex-hs
an implementation a subset of regular expression parsing and execution. I worked on this repository after my 3rd year of university to learn some of the Haskell ecosystem and apply accepted software practices, such as:
- Test-Driven Development
- making incremental, small commits with Git
- using existing packages. Notable are the `parsec` library for parsing and `HSpec` + `QuickCheck` for unit testing
